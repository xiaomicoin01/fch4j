## General rules of FIPA protocols



## Rules specific to this protocol

1. CoinDays can be simply understood as: (quantity of coins) multiplied by (holding time).
2. Exact calculation. <br>
  The precision of FCH is 0.00000001 FCH, or 1 Satoshi. 

```python
    # e.g. : 987654321 Satoshi = 9.87 Coins
    Coins = (SatoshiOfUTXO / 1000000) /100.0
```

  The Timestamp in the blockheader is seconds from Unix Epoch, and we need to format it to Days. We define the calculation as follows:
    
```
    Days =  (generatedTimestamp - spentTimestamp) / (24 * 3600)
    generatedTimestamp = Timestamp of blockHeader when UTXO is generated
    spentTimestamp = Timestamp of blockHeader when the UTXO is spent
```

## CoinDays of a UTXO

```
    CoinDays of a UTXO =  CoinsOfUTXO * DaysOfUTXO
```

## CoinDays of an CID
   An CID may has more than one UTXOs. The CoinDays of an CID is the sum of all its UTXO's CoinDays.

```
    sum(CoinDays of a UTXO)
```

## The consumption of CoinDays
